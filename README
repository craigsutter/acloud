OVERVIEW:

Designed to take advantage of the Google Plus Android functionality that automatically uploads all photos taken with the phone camera to a Picaca (Google Photo) album named 'Instant Upload'.
Use automator or cron to schedule this app to run periodically and you have a poor man's iCloud:)


Sample usage:

public static void main (args){
        Photo ph = new Photo("GOOGLE_USER","PASSWORD")
        AlbumEntry instantUploadAlbum = ph.getInstantUploadAlbum()

        if (instantUploadAlbum == null){
            println "Instant Upload album not found for user, exiting..."
            return
        }

        List pics = ph.getRecentlyUploadedPics(instantUploadAlbum)
        if (pics.size() > 0){
            ph.downloadPhotos(pics)
            ph.importPhotosToiPhoto()
        }else{
            println "No pics to download and import..."
        }
    }
